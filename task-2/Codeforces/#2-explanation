The number of words to be entered is inputed...i used a 1D character array to input the words into...then i used a 2D character array to store all the words together...i also used an integer array to store the lengths of the words...
after getting all the words its all stored together in the 2D array..then its all passed on to the user defined function...where it first checks if the length is above 10 characters...if it is above 10 then it get abbreviated..else the entire word is printed.
