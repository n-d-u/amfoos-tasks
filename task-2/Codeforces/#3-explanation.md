The number of participants,the k-th position,the score are inputted.i have been using cin and this is the first time im using scanf to implement a code.i used scanf to get the inputs.These were passed onto a user defined function to compare..if the score is greater than th score of the k-th then a variable count is increamented.Thus the total number of participants who scored more than the k-th is obtained.
