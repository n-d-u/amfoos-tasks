After coding the first task on hackerrank i learned the format used there and i learned to shorten the code...i created a 2d array for the matrix...and an integer for the size...I created a user defined functon to find the diffeence...in the main diagonal the column no and row number will be equall i used this logic to find the sum of the first diagonal...after giving much thought i spotted a pattern in the second diagonal the coloumn number decrease in accordance with the row number..i used this pattern to find the second diagonal...i googled for a function to find the absolute value and i used the abs() function (to avoid using if-else and shorten the code).....and the absolute value of difference was displayed
